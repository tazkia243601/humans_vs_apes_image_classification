# humans_vs_apes_image_classification
a convolutional neutral network using tensorflow distinguishing between humans and apes 
NOT DONE!!!!

  `footnote at the end`

## why i built this project
the week before we had to do this project i had watched planet of the apes 2001 and the planet of the apes trilogy and before i knew that apes were pretty remarkable using tools to fish out termites in holes and they express emotions in a way very similar to humans however after watching the movies it made me think about apes more and the similarites and differences between them and us.
  
  during the first 2 meetings about the project and the consequent activites about what kind of images i would train the neural network on i thought of the movies and comparing humans and apes. i knew that it will be able to differentiate between white people and south east asians and most probably between south asians but i was curious about the neural network distinguishing between black people as the skin colour is similar to gorillas. i recalled an article about google photos mistakenly added two black friends in an album called gorillas. i wondered if i would get the same results.

## what problem does it solve
this convolutional neural network differenciates between humans and apes

## what i have learned while doing this project
i understand basic neural network code like what does what and neural network theory for example what a pooling layer is. i learned about different libraries such as tensorflow and keras
  
  i also have realised how annoying it is to collect your own data
  
## how did you collect the data/where did you get the data from
for the apes i screenshotted pictures from [alarmy stock photo](https://www.alamy.com/) as it was very hard to find free ape pictures.
for the humans i used a free stock image site: [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). for each group there is 100 images split 80% training and 20& validation

## talk about how good your machine learning model is
it is very good the accuracy is 0.975 and the validation accuracy is 0.95. the neural network differenciates between white humans male and female and gorillas with a 0.999 probability

```
i have only trained the neural network on white adults and children and gorillas. i need to collect other races of humans which i will train the neural network soon
