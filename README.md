# humans_vs_apes_image_classification
a convolutional neutral network using tensorflow distinguishing between humans and apes 

  `footnote at the end`

## why i built this project
the week before we had to do this project i had watched planet of the apes 2001 and the planet of the apes trilogy and before i knew that apes were pretty remarkable using tools to fish out termites in holes and they express emotions in a way very similar to humans however after watching the movies it made me think about apes more and the similarites and differences between them and us.
  
  during the first 2 meetings about the project and the consequent activites about what kind of images i would train the neural network on i thought of the movies and comparing humans and apes. i knew that it will be able to differentiate between white people and south east asians and most probably between south asians but i was curious about the neural network distinguishing between black people as the skin colour is similar to gorillas. i recalled an article about google photos mistakenly added two black friends in an album called gorillas. i wondered if i would get the same results.

## what problem does it solve
this convolutional neural network differenciates between humans and apes

## what i have learned while doing this project
i understand basic neural network code like what does what and neural network theory for example what a pooling layer is. i learned about different libraries such as tensorflow and keras
  
  i also have realised how annoying it is to collect your own data
  
## how did you collect the data/where did you get the data from
for the apes i screenshotted pictures from [alarmy stock photo](https://www.alamy.com/) as it was very hard to find free ape pictures.
for the humans i used a free stock image site: [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). 

## talk about how good your machine learning model is
it is very good the
